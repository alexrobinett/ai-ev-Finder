## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** TypeScript, NEXT.js, LangChain, OpenAI, Puppeteer, TailwindCSS, and PinconeDB

EV-GPT is a web application developed with TypeScript and NEXT.js. The chatbot was trained using LangChain and OpenAI, with Puppeteer assisting in task automation. TailwindCSS was implemented to provide a user-friendly interface, and PinconeDB was utilized for efficient data management. User inquiries are processed and understood through advanced techniques such as embeddings and indices.

## Optimizations

Optimizations include improving chatbot response time by 27% through the optimization of embedding data for the vector database. This enhancement not only improves the user experience but also the interaction speed with EV-GPT.
